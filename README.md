CIS536 Term Project
==================

Idea
==================
For our term project, Tyler and Devin will be creating a camping scene that contains at least a campfire and reflective water.

Implementation
==================
The models for the scene and the scene will be  created using blender. The scene will then be exported to be used within a C# application using the OpenTK library. The reflective water effect will be done by applying shaders to the scene. The fire effect will be done using a particle system. The C# application will add the reflective water and fire effects to the scene.

Division of Work
==================
* Tyler will be responsible for creating the reflective water effect.
* Devin will be responsible for creating the fire effect.
* Both Tyler and Devin will be responsible for creating the scene.
